# About

This project is the cpp implementation of various algorithms and little challenges.

The goal is to implement:
* The sorting algorithms from the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
* The algorithms and data structures from the CLRS book
* The challenges from the Euler project
* The interviews questions from cracking the coding interview book

My goal is to improve my C++ skills and remain seasoned with regard to algorithmic problems.

# Implemented

## sorting

* Bubble sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort

# Issues

If you see a bad implementation, have a question or have an interesting algorithm that I could implement, feel free to open an issue.

# Note

This is a work in progress that will evolve rather slowly as I work on several different projects.
